and i mean really be her friend .
sounds like a rhetorical question : )
i do n't want to be mean .
because some women send men tiny messages with out saying it clearly .
lets get coffee and chat and take it from there !
i also hate seeing my dad unhappy .
ask him to go see a doc .
besides do n't you think he has enough to worry about ?
but i dont htink that by not having sex with him he will become unfaithful or leave you .
anyway my question is ... . will i always feel that way ?
but he might enjoy all the waiting , dreaming & teasing .
and i want to try again .
not all the time , sometimes men shave them , it depends on the woman ,
well if u really like this guy smile and make nice talk with him .
i do n't know about love , but he likes you for sure
i can onli say ... women r complicated ...
i know i 'm overtly picky about people how can i stop it !
it does sound a little girlie .
sometimes the difficulties are worth it if the the good outweighs the bad
that 's if u both agreed on doing this .
well , if the one boy picks on you , why like him ?
also sometimes guys think they dont need you so bad until your gone .
but if a guy asks u dont be afraid to say no .
do i want to be in love ?
if you look creepy and you look..they 'll all think you 're leering .
confusing ... yeah , i think your right .
how do i get my sweetheart to show me he loves me
if u really really really really really really like them
( even if he is rich , dont sell ur self .
u sound like a very lovely person so dont let some of these gals drag you down .
i dont know.but i know of another website that i go to..
no seriously , think about howmany cocky girls are out there .
without having a boyfriend would be a bit slutty .
then he said do you want some of my chapstick ?
you never let a man mistreat you
nope , he 's too darned big and i 'm too darned weak !
and if he says yes than you can tell him .
what was the mistake that you did
king had a song about this - only your mother loves you ( and see might be jiving too ) .
we fall in love they treat us bad why are we there
and if you have , what was it like ?
if she gets drunk then it is not a turn off .
only if you want it to be .
it 's like breaking a drug habit .
oh man i should do that when im dating next time !
but you do what you want .
it sounds like you are both comfortable with things just the way they are .
do n't let her rule your life , she will just have to learn to deal with it .
if he does n't then there are too many fish in the sea .
no single man can give you what you really want .
that said u need to figure out youself if u want to stay married to him .
start with a basic everyday question and go from there : )
ask if they wan na go somewhere with you .
trust him , do n't bring it up again .
: ) i have n't tried it yet , but i am still trying to get up the nerve ... .
just find one that loves you too .
come to my town ill be your girl ... .
stay 100 miles away from this guy .
it 's your choice not to hate one , i dislike them to say the least .
i would say around 3 or 4
he 's telling that to some gurls too ... he 's a womanizer..
probably because i knew all the girlfriends were not really the one until i met my wife .
and whatever you do , do n't try to have both of them at once .
sex is not the only thing important in life damn it ! ! ! ! !
i have yahoo email and that works for me .
fun includes eating meals ( not breakfast if yo know what i mean ) .
but he was a lil busy after that .
and that will be just s*x !
please do n't go up to her and tell her how good she looks .
sounds like u r going through a lot right now .
but ask a girl about the sympthoms because i 'm a boy .
i always felt the same way , but i met my true love and my views changed !
but -- there 's no better person to marry someday than your best friend !
i dont wan na just randomly go up nd be like go out wiht me ?
you sorta stuck yourself out thier to get hurt , unless you know him fairly well .
no good or bad is your personal belief on something .
they bother u all day long .
go to hawaii ... ha ha ha or ... .pay someone ... lol
i can just toss him to side and forget about him like last night 's trash ... ... ..lol
like clear liquid and turns yellow when dry ?
if she sits on your bestfriends lap because she is drunk then yes it is a turn off .
! he must be a control freak
its one of the gifts we can always give ourselves .
and get married only after you 've been with a guy for more than 2 years .
to all my fellow girls at cone , a big hi and hug !
just be yourself when you are with her .
what the hell r ya talking abt ?
... a guy asks me , 'do you mind if we cuddle ?
but some guys would do that ... why ?
there are lost of good women left you just have to look in the right place .
either you move on with your life or you try to make it work with this person .
get a grip , how can you love someone that you do n't even communicate with .
find a girl who has talets she also must be prety
it does n't mean that you are slutty .
the one time in your life to really live out the true fantasy of love !
you have to search yourself for this one ...
give them 2 months they will get over you .
after a while you dont even see the color .
he is probably wondering if your interested in him at all ... .flirt back ! !
if she is not into you anymore ...
you are definitely not a hoe , do n't worry .
; ) there is no way to make someone fall in love with you .
if you 're asking , then you should break-up w/ and open yourself to other options .
have you ever had a pap smear .
yes all i can say.. but yes , i have long black hair and im proud ! !
i had a friend in the same situation .
maybe your young , i do n't know .
hi , my name is xxxxxx been working for me for years .
if you truely love him you will tell him
just go with your feelings if you like her so much then go with it .
ask yourself and decide.and if you can afford it , do if you want to .
stay alive and get your old life back .
dude , what your sayin is she does n't want to be more than bf and gf ?
do n't use pick up lines , that 's a turn off .
it hurts ... .alot ... maybe some girls might say that 's it ?
( it would be easier to do if i were mad , though ! !
if they have moved on then you should too .
no , you are punish , and no tv for a month
tell him , and it would n't seem psycho cuz u have kno each other for a long time
it is very complcated tell it again please but in simple
give them a chance to discover you .
unless it 's with the wrong man .
my bf loves me to death and doesnt want to give me up .
depends on if they are brunette or not
it 's got to get played out after a while .
everybody likes to be told that they 're hot , even if they do n't admit it !
downtown houston just about any weekend ... lots of clubs ...
good luck but do your homework !
i 'll go with anything natural than fake i even hate the word fake
if you like the guy then go for it .
only now she and i are both divorced .
who said women dont feel anything ?
no matter what he says , action speaks louder then words
i was thinking about a medium pink color , but with what ? ?
see if he calls , e-mails or even cares .
and never ignore her always listen to her ... and when you do do n't change the subjetct women hate that .
i am in college and he is my only sourse of income until i get out .
she will tell you if it 's not ok .
i dont think i mind either way .
do n't eat where you take a s*** .
also try getting some blonde highlights
dont worry about him n just sonsentrate in school so you can lern n then woory bout yer b/f
ohhh this is what i did - big bad mistake on my part .
you give at least 5 minutes for kissing and huging and may be some licking also .
what special gift can i give my would be brother in law for his birthday ?
try to be your self and do n't show off
if they dont then you 'll have to get on with your life .
but ur first kiss should feel like ur in hevan .
i feel this is most beautiful in a family life .
lol most important ... just be yourself .
i know 3 guys that i can probably get away with doing something like that .
if he if flurting with her ok jump him .
stick with the 13 & 14 year old boys .. they are easier to control anyway.. lol good luck
tell him that u jst wannabe friends and that u r relly disappointed that he would act so dumb ! ! !
i guess it 's kind of nice , it 's like your dad 's blessing all the way .
wait for him to ask u out unless ur real desprete
if he insists , it means he only after sex .
i would like to have some fun with u that 's why i answered this stupid question
do u fell that way ?
give your brother some money and tell him to take a hike ! !
maybe he 's going to call you !
a good way is to imagine yourself without him/her .
so i guess i pick domestic goddess .
do u love her in depth ?
also men get bored and tire way before woman do .
a big savings area is flowers .
if you are n't happy fix it or get out .
just because he has the potential to be a great boyfriend doesnt mean he is .
you can do a civilian arrest answ3r3r
u can have a big u-no-what , n suck in bed .
so so sexy yes it look very nice on most any girl
guys have a problem with secrets .
yes but it dipends of the guy
people asked me - whats the hurry ?
they both dont respect your feeling .
ok i see him ever week in psr but i just cant talk to him ! ! !
i dont like a guy dat does dat all da time .
i think it 's totally hot when a guy shaves his legs .
did turn gay or is it a curiosity thing ?
i myself think that they do .
it is a mistake that ca n't be undone !
in a park when i was 16 i lost my virgenate
they never met but she says they 're in love .
and ask if he wants to dance with you .
and people life is to short live it to the fulliest and have faith
did you fell goog because i want to have sex , but you have to be careful
like i said ; he already knows that you like him , so just take a deep breathe and ask him .
keep away ur fear and tell him .
and im sure as heck not driving 5 hrs just to hang out unless i really really like her .
does she have other friends to gab with on the fone ?
play sports with your guy friends .
when you first fall in love , your gitty , goofy , and silly happy just thinking about that person .
i ca n't see my life without my husband .
we always seem to push the ones taht we love away .
wait til you get older and if you both still feel the same way then go for it !
you are a man < -- - term used lightly ! !
i prefer a & b cups , myself .
any women beside the ugly guys will look hot ...
it happened to me and i am now dating that person
just let her know what you feel .
show her your naked baby pictures .
why do gays want to get married ?
on the hood of my car at a waterfront in a light rain it was awesome !
and women also expect guys to act like that , so why should they grow up ?
but you need to do this a few times .
whle making love is like living a fantasy .
as for now i think he is mad , hurt , upset and got over you .
if anyone know let me know
red= love , black = death ect ...
i like thick because i feel cheated with a thin one !
if you do n't know ask someone who would .
then comes the fun part ... he making it up to you : - )
wow , go with the one that picks on you because 9 times out out 10 he likes you
ok i have liked this on girl since i was in ninth grade .
you catch her looking at you ?
i never knew life could be so good ! ! ! !
do whats best for you and he
hey it 's better than her givin u a fake # to call lol !
so in my opinon ur not a hoe !
but if they can not exercise self-control , let them marry .
she calls him all the time .
you are already doing it so why yet bother ?
there are many times that you love the guy but not sure did he love you also .
should i dump him because of his mother
make a kind move , if no responce u know what to do !
i 've heard of friends getting married about 6 months after meeting somebody .
show her what you 're good at .
you will look like an idiot .
finally a culture that has it right .
if you do n't you 'll always wonder .
i would n't worry too much about it .
what 's the worst that could happen .
i 'm confused i hate the girl to be like that ... what shall i do ?
preferrably someone who does n't hate you .
stop trying to slap it in everyones face ! ! !
some guys just do n't like to dance .
this generation is just too stupid .
it depends on if you could trust him before !
ugly ( or fat ) guys just take what they can get .
people are husbands and wives for reasons ! ! !
if all you do is argue it 's not worth it..
have fun in jail asking that question to your cell mate .
u are asking do u like me
depending on what you kissed ; )
) women are curious about sex with other women , even me !
20 to 32 ... she does n't have to be younger than you .
then u can make an easier decision .
but he chaeted , so i guess i can lift or carry my husband .
just try and make the best of what 's to come .
depending on what yo uare looking for , freindship only , like .
i think he would make a great valentine .
( this is really hard because there are a lot of temptations out there ) .
is it usually about a year before both people begin 2 feel in that comfortable , boring , stage ? ?
it all depends on when ur ready .
hell ya i would love to meet the ladys ! !
dont try to figure it out thats jus the way it is .
remember being friends with someone online is ok but there are limits .
if u can imagine him as the father of ur children !
if he turns you down , hes not worth it in the first place ! ! ! !
well to tell u tha truth u learn but u have to actually do it .
you married your hubby hopefully because you love him .
i know i have someone to come home to .
get a massage..and get away from it all..hehe..
i have no idea where to begin ! ! !
that depends ... are you a hottie w/a body ?
r u talking about ur avatar ?
if a guy cares he calls .
however , i always believed in the fact there 's a huge different between having sex and making love .
do n't just stay with him for the baby .
are you a country girl or a city girl .
getting married and getting child can wait but studies ca n't .
i have never been to it
the same guy you wan na be in a relationship with ?
how often can you have sex with pam anderson ?
make sure you dont make her hate you just get your point across too her
my mom also has cancer and this just hits to close to home for me .
i love curly hair i like to run my fingers thru it
i mean the both of you together .
u just have to be patient and the right girl will come along .
i want my wife to grow too .
you should probaly make a move because he is obviosly shy
the doctor ca n't even believe it .
may be u think not but yes ! ! !
no men do n't but little boys do
how about ... would you like to go out with me sometime ?
hell , it happened to me twice .
you should n't go out with a guy because you 'need ' to .
if you really wanted to be with him , you would n't be asking .
and i hope to god it does n't ever pass !
honestly , most girls are just waiting for the guy to tell her how he truly feels .
plus they are more passionate in love makin .
never stop trying to impress her .
leaning in and giving me a soft kiss just on the forehead .
yes im not one of those people but i know there are lots of them
ok it depends on how much your starting to have feelings for this boy !
thanks for the pep in advance !
why do they want to be married ? ? ?
we like soft approch and a lil bit of chasing .
-a trip to amusement park such as roller coaster or even theatrical museum .
i like sos and need to know if im in love
do you like fake nails or manicured ones ?
only two points to make friends 1 .
i do n't know what u mean .
well , you , and that sexy perfume you wear ! !
it really depends on the guy but i think most guys seriously do n't care .
i ca n't explain it ... and no , it has nothing to do with them looking young , vulnerable or submissive .
as everyone said ... dont get married so early .
if you plan on cheating on your wife ... you 're a freaking pig and need to be shot !
then be your best self , if he 's impressed or likes you he 'll talk back
you dont want anyone else but that person ever
do n't persue it , he is getting married .
have you told her that it 's kind of irritating with her having to check up on you everyday ?
so , when i moved in my neighbor asked me out .
most teen boyz prefer girls that like sex .
he dribbles ... he shoots ... he scores ... 2 points ...
if not , then do n't sweat it !
do you like to argue and fight ? ? ?
the main thing is to not try to get back at the one who wronged you .
one man willing to move 21 hours/1,400 miles just to be with me .
just want to know have you been to the doc yet !
maybe she 's not a beeeatch and the skinny chick was
get a life and do n't waste mine .
its like if you decide to eat chocalate and then moan cuz u look too fat .
i went and there he was .
if he is , then go for it !
men like this , typically become wife beaters if you do n't obey them !
you like him or you do n't like him ?
but if u are sure then first tell your parents if you havent done allready .
many people will tell you no !
if u think that he feels the same way about you , why not ?
so there are some guys that only say the l word if they mean it .
it defenetely looks like he has feelings for u.do u show how u feel ; ; u should ! !
well i believe everybody should keep their own name .
guys come & go , but friends are forever !
imgaine if it was just considered love ? ?
if your relationship survive the four seasons ... i guess you should be ready ... .
ok now some guy 's like girls like that and some do n't
if you want kids , then homemaker .
should i or should n't i. younger guy vs older woman
of course he wants to go on .
so it would have to be love .
ur self image is also very important .
im a gilr , i say those things ... .
girls are just as perverted -- trust me .
: ) although , flowers are really nice even if they do n't last .
there are movies that i have n't seen yet .
it is realy sweet and just what u r looking for !
my be she do n't love you but try to use your brean not your haerd
no offense , but it kinda sounds like a girls name ya know but no disrespect intended !
i would n't bother calling him back .
none come in my list so i choose my neighbors wife : d
marriage is really about trusting & communicating
do n't listen to what anyone else tells you to do .
what shuld i do to get her ?
give a rose and express ur love
its unusal yes , but nothing bad .
you have to find whats right for you and your partner/s !
coz they are girls man and they are not as sofisticated as we are !
yes for sure , especially when she throw up ! !
i ca n't help any more unless i have more infor .
there is n't a wrong or right way to kiss anyone .
do you have to rush your choice ?
having fun with guy friends is ok. 1 .
it 's more of a trust issue i 'd say .
i just need someone to help me figer this out
then if he still does n't like you , then move on .
he probably doesnt want to either .
when possible , try to make it yourself .
yeah ok men work and fix things but what else can you do ?
i told her that i loved her and truly meant it .
all seniors think freshman girls are easy , its sad but true
so how do i just kiss him
go to deleted items and it should be there
i hope you find a nice girl .
i do n't think it 's good idea , u are not there for this purpose !
the list could go on and on .
brokeback mountain , ok it 's a guy but at least you 'll be happy !
i think as long as you dont base your relationship on sex its ok
yes , and it is bad luck to see the bride at the wedding .
good luck and hang in there .
umm small party for the family
and if you are worried about doing it - performance wise - dont .
i would be , but i 'm just married !
i think it all depends on age , upbringing , .
you both should pick either his or yours once you have kids .
your kid is going to have hard enough time growing up without a dad .
men without hair look like little boys to me , and it 's not sexy at all .
or ask about the score of last game ?
get rid of the x if you are dating the guy you love right now .
the best way and easiest way is to fly or drive to las vegas and get married there .
sure let me know more 'bout you
anything bigger than a handful is a waste , probably a size c or d
lie lie lie and then lie some more
they have never proformed before and it doubles the plesure !
wife says , we do n't wear that shit .
we dont no what you look like !
bcozz we always find a life partner therfor we attract with opposite side
lol i think this is better than the one on top of me ...
do n't go anywhere you went with him or her .
talk 2 your best friend and see if its cool
sounds strange but it worked in about 3-5 days for me !
when he teases you about the stupid little things .
no , because i 'm not married yet
lots of men like thick girls , most of them are black .
no and u shouldnt care.if u like him then stay with him .
or does his friends point at you when your with him .
if you feel this strongly about it then maybe you should n't get married .
it really depends if someone is vain or not .
move on and find someone who does n't hate you .
you should get to know her and sooner or later you will ask her out or she will .
so ofcourse i had to ask him if he was blowin me off .
maybe some perverted guys like the really young looking asian girls
whatever you decide , make it completly yours !
tell him you do n't want a real relationship .
there is nothing but trouble there !
not always the easiest but they have been pretty good years .
and hes seen me every day for about 4 or 5 years !
imagine that i am that guy and be my girl freind !
it never hurts to be flirty !
but stick with wats inside of u .
best of luck to you both : )
i 've been with this girl for 8 months and we have n't kissed is this bad ?
depends on the woman , it 's better shaved=- )
i think they just look better than a whole lot of nations out there .
even the day after would be okay .
then see if shes open for a dinner & a movie .
yes some men get right down to it with absolutly no thought for the woman .
ask in english terms ... can not understand you
sorry , i never have felt that way !
remember , no bird ever flew on one wing ! !
i actually ponder this one now and again .
u seem desperate and you 'll never find a if you 're desperate .
imet a girl and i want to know how to know if shes into me or not
but do n't just sit around waiting for the phone to ring .
shut the hell up and be gay if you want to ! ! !
if he comes to his senses then great if not screw him ! !
i mean if u love him and he really loves u he may want to disapoint his father .
do it before it is to late
this gal does not want a bad boy at all .
i`d like to see what a black female has to say about this .
help me win this debate with her !
most often ( not always ) that will be guys around your age , give ot take .
when will people in this effed up world finally realize this ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! ? !
and i dont know what i should do .
you go to a bar and get drunk !
i did this with my current boyfriend .
no , not if you have to ask ...
rather than just sit there and wait till u are a good one .
( and now even in devorce im stuck with it !
your girlfriend will just think you 're a jerk .
maybe you should try dating girls if guys offend you so .
my ex of 3 years cheated .
time wiil tell give it six months and see what happens .
well , the one i liked goes like this .
not all guys get bored and move on .
they 're a lot of fun - there 's plenty to do .
but it is okay to kiss on the first date .
i have a close girl friend .
they are always in the 'in love ' stage .
my friend says i am to nice and i should tell them no .
but ( there 's always a but is n't there ?
not all guys , but some guys do
that way you can still go by your last name !
go up to her and say 'hi , are you single ? '
that got me really hot , but i ran off .
however that does not mean that big girls ca n't be cute .
not everyone on here is in school .
practice unwrapping starburst with ur tongue , and tieing cherry stems w/ your tongue .
me , i 'll pick up the tab if , i can get your vote for best answer .
you should probably be looking in a public place where you are most comfortable .
flirt and see how he reponds
plus it takes the pressure off of me to ask someone ...
say will u go out with me ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
( i mess up alot at times ) but she do n't forget .
is how should i approach her and be not just another guy hitting on her ?
as a guy - let me say this .
you 're 13 do n't even worry about it ...
always trail ride with a friend .
if you guys truely love each other then u can work out all the fighting etc .
its all in the eye contact
yup , i can lift him , he 's only 185 ... .lol
he just has to start over and earn your trust again .
sak her out what 's up with that ?
well i hope you read this really well .
play a truth or dare game together
wait until you find that out for sure first and then go from there !
stupid u need a theory class 4 that ! ! ! ! ! ! !
if you do eat something like that then just quit .
now i keep thinking of getting it on with a girl .
confront him and ask him that way you will know
yes jaime is going to ask rubi out ... . but it is not yoru business ...
because neither of you have the guts to call it quits
may be its interesting for them
he dribbles ... he shoots ... he scores ... 2 points ...
or do guys really do prefer bigger women ?
he loves you , too , girl ... time will tell .
if a guy really respects u then he 'll understand .
this is sin , our selves have started this
his answer is good enough for me ...
move on , but you can still luv him ! !
