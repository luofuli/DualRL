just be prepared cause if it happen once it can happen again !

why do gays want to get married ?
do you have to rush your choice ?
they both dont respect your feeling .
no seriously , think about howmany cocky girls are out there .
she is too afraid to ask him out .
get a grip , how can you love someone that you do n't even communicate with .

why does it matter what they think if they dont get along dont spend time togather .
if he is then you have a good man .
if he likes you , you 'll know !
i guess its normal , but id just move on
i like any guy that is funny .
girl only you can decide on this ...
do go telling everyone just because you think thats right .
10 years gap is just nice .
then if he still does n't like you , then move on .
beacuse they feel insecure with less educated guys ... ... ... .
for one thing if it does n't work out there goes your job .
and i hope to god it does n't ever pass !
only the ones that are n't worth your time
you guys do n't have any reason to hate each other .
if you do n't you 'll always wonder .
some people choose not to because of thier religion , others do n't .
give it a chance because if you break up with them it would be harder to be friends
the best of luck to ya !
men who were not ready to committ .

yes im not one of those people but i know there are lots of them
no , not if you have to ask ...
coz they are girls man and they are not as sofisticated as we are !
' ... does this mean he likes me ? .
i dated one and i know .
look at the way she walks .
no ( at least i hope not ) .
hello : i am looking to visit your country .
overtime should i give him another chance ?
the same guy you wan na be in a relationship with ?
i went and there he was .
( that 's what i called it ) .. but , why ?
that way you can still go by your last name !
i have told her i liked her and she said she would want to ruin or friendship .
you can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat
show her your naked baby pictures .
but i am not telling you to be celibate till then ; - )
if he if flurting with her ok jump him .
i love curly hair i like to run my fingers thru it
i want my wife to grow too .
well that is just the way it is i guess .
i can just toss him to side and forget about him like last night 's trash ... ... ..lol
but he was a lil busy after that .
i do not know what to do because she knows how much i care about him .
if you do eat something like that then just quit .
it could be that u need to piss or the last dream u had
you know ... ... .if he wants to wear my pants all he has to do is ask ... ... .sheesh !
if you were friends before and have stronger feelings now then it should be o > k >
and i want to try again .
figure out what style of arrangements you would like and flowers .
lie lie lie and then lie some more
wait until you find that out for sure first and then go from there !
if you two are at a dance , he should n't really care .
trust him , do n't bring it up again .
honestly , most girls are just waiting for the guy to tell her how he truly feels .
i actually ponder this one now and again .
i met this guy once , very romantic , i met him in this huge rainstorm .
ok now some guy 's like girls like that and some do n't
it comes right after threeplay and before fiveplay .
when i fall in love , i feel stupid .
if you have to ask , then you are not in love .
if you start to feel the it comming on then start the four play again .
i do n't understand someone please give me the answer
i saved a good $ 500-600 doing my own flowers and it was no hassle at all .
but ask a girl about the sympthoms because i 'm a boy .
be you show a little toghness thats what girls like atleast most of them but mostly be yourself
follow ur heart ... it 's neva wrong
they bother u all day long .
see if he calls , e-mails or even cares .
you can do a civilian arrest answ3r3r
a spasm in your back usually
by now , you might love your wife for everything you guys have endured .
good luck and i hope everything goes well !
say i love you and if the wait to say it back it tells it all
try asking her out again and see what she says .
; ) there is no way to make someone fall in love with you .
ask her questions ( do n't just talk ) .
and remember there is more then 1 !
i think they just look better than a whole lot of nations out there .
we got married all over again !
all in all i do n't think it really matters .
and im sure as heck not driving 5 hrs just to hang out unless i really really like her .
how often can you have sex with pam anderson ?
i told her that i loved her and truly meant it .
think about what good it brought about .
the thing is im a person that does not like to brake others heart .
give a rose and express ur love
i like thick because i feel cheated with a thin one !
bcozz we always find a life partner therfor we attract with opposite side
what the hell r ya talking abt ?
if you keep talking to him for another week , he might think he is married to you .
women dont want much , just some acknowldgement and sometimes help .
at least thats what it seems like to me .
do n't be afraid to say no .
dump him ... there are always more fish in the sea .
to me it realy dose'nt matter , but a hand full is quite enought for me .
choose the one that adores you the most !
you still released at least a thousand !
you go to a bar and get drunk !
give it some time and thought .
no u shouldnt leave them ... just teach them what to do to please u better ...
bembie hit the nail on the head
no.u guys kiss when ur ready
haha julesac is funny , but mean .
if youre asking this , u surely have already distanced yourself from her and yet remaining a friend .
dont try to figure it out thats jus the way it is .
i dont know.but i know of another website that i go to..
ok it depends on how much your starting to have feelings for this boy !
! he must be a control freak
it all depends on the girl or the and how intersted the girl is in the guy .
look , try and get out to meet people .
usually it is multiple things not just one thing
if u really really really really really really like them
for the guys : ( a ) do you prefer a bigger woman or a smaller woman ?
if all you do is argue it 's not worth it..
u just have to be patient and the right girl will come along .
wife because then you can do more with out comminting a sin
depends , some days i want to have sex , somedays i do n't .
plus they are more passionate in love makin .
maybe because your the most beautiful girl they have seen .
it really depends if someone is vain or not .
someone i can be myself with .
send me your picture and contact me ..
stay away from this guy friend .
the doctor ca n't even believe it .
if not , then do n't sweat it !
i could give you some pointers .
if you feel your love is fading , do n't just sit there and do nothing !
i will not stay with someone i do n't trust .
i only once told a girl that i loved her , and i meant it .
you married him and it was for a reason .
rip off your shirt and do a tarzan yell .
yes , girl down there , do n't have sex .
they accept this in thier culture .
always trail ride with a friend .
you did n't give us very good information/ do you all live in one house .
move on - so what if he 's hot ... looks are n't everything .
lol most important ... just be yourself .
sorry , i never have felt that way !
i sure wont like any girl who would make my life difficult ...
or if he gets them first , you get the popcorn .
practice , ask if your doing good .
but if u are sure then first tell your parents if you havent done allready .
well i met mine in a carnival .
sounds like a rhetorical question : )
well i believe everybody should keep their own name .
but ur first kiss should feel like ur in hevan .
there is nothing but trouble there !
how to make a woman happy to make a woman happy ... . ?
dont do things tht can get you hurt .
i mean of course you will be making more money if you work hard .
please do n't go up to her and tell her how good she looks .
i do n't think it 's good idea , u are not there for this purpose !
go up to her and say 'hi , are you single ? '
i think he would make a great valentine .
just be prepared to let her go .
rather than just sit there and wait till u are a good one .
get a massage..and get away from it all..hehe..
well if u really like this guy smile and make nice talk with him .
take them both out at the same time
it happened to me and i am now dating that person
only two points to make friends 1 .
so you might just be over looking the type of men who think the world of you..
preferrably someone who does n't hate you .
we tried to move on but it did n't work .
i would n't bother calling him back .
try not to hang out with him and find another guy .
look for another hot girl , so she will be jealous .
so in my opinon ur not a hoe !
red= love , black = death ect ...
if she likes him than she dont like u dump her is not his fault that she strays
for me anything after 3 days and i might start to forget about you .
find a girl who has talets she also must be prety
there no one you can trust more than a good friend !
start the day off with breakfast out ... then perhaps a nice walk .
then go pick them up ( if she say yes ) .
if yes , why do i heard some girl said flowers ar not going to last ?
may be its interesting for them
could it ever be the same ...
it 's not that bad ... at least it is not bella
or you could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances ...
finally a culture that has it right .
my twin wont talk or listen to me
want to get something you can not get rid of go ahead then
only i am not thinking about him but i am having dreams about him .
if ur talkin ten then i think it would be fine to get a video/ computer game .
if he ca n't then take him to a place where they have slowdances ( dinner date , maybe ? )
i feel this is most beautiful in a family life .
it 's your choice not to hate one , i dislike them to say the least .
never ever get married without a prenup ... .
get a life and do n't waste mine .
she says your too good for her ?
guys come & go , but friends are forever !
it could probably mean a lot of things .
yes it is normal cause their is lots of people who still likes some they broke up with .
i`d like to see what a black female has to say about this .
guys are stupid ! who knows why they do what they do .
well if they gave you their phone number you dont have to wait at all
cause were masters of the universe ...
i 'm in love and do n't care who knows it buddy the elf .
and whatever you do , do n't try to have both of them at once .
if you really wanted to be with him , you would n't be asking .
remember being friends with someone online is ok but there are limits .
when my sis kisses someone she closes her eyes to get ready .
umm small party for the family
girls are perverts they just hide it and act like it around other girls secretly
and im only in fith grade o ya !
but you do what you want .
do n't do that , it wo n't work .
if they do n't , it 's time to move on .
he everything i ever wanted with the looks , money , stuff .
yes , and it is bad luck to see the bride at the wedding .
nope , she is not a liar .
and he had his nose pierced .
yup , i can lift him , he 's only 185 ... .lol
you need a therapist for that .
maybe some perverted guys like the really young looking asian girls
you should go see a shrink !
giving you stupid excuses of the wall ! acting the way he did n't before !
be strong , and hang in there .
nope , he 's too darned big and i 'm too darned weak !
basically if she is so drunk that she becomes a slob / or slut then yes it is unattractive ...
especially if you do n't feel like it .
he dribbles ... he shoots ... he scores ... 2 points ...
giving it up just for him to stick around is like selling your soul to the devil .
i cant give you a wife view but hopefully mine is just as good .
plus it takes the pressure off of me to ask someone ...
depends on the woman , it 's better shaved=- )
ask in english terms ... can not understand you
hey , i 'm a guy , but i 'll tell you a little .
i like him alot and i want to win him over not push him away .
ok like i really really really like this guy and i dont know if he likes me back .
btw - ur avatar looks familiar .
it 's been over 6 months & i ca n't seem to get over it .
maybe he thinks he will be turned down.just ask ... i would .
you got ta think about that and that should help you out on seeing if you can trust him !
a picture the shape of a heart with you and her when you both first dated ... .thats special
i am in college and he is my only sourse of income until i get out .
i 've been with this girl for 8 months and we have n't kissed is this bad ?
some guys do n't like boobs at all !
or that she just wants to see other people ?
and hes seen me every day for about 4 or 5 years !
there was his stop so he got off the train .
but , i know exactly what i want in a relationship .
i would flirt and send flowers and candies to my self and then he would ask u out sometime
i also hate seeing my dad unhappy .
i feel bad because i know that i snore sometime -- most people do , right ?
i like sos and need to know if im in love
if you guys truely love each other then u can work out all the fighting etc .
because neither of you have the guts to call it quits
however that does not mean that big girls ca n't be cute .
but he is getting married this month .
but those guys are jerks and you do n't want them anwyay .
and get married only after you 've been with a guy for more than 2 years .
man has penis and woman has clitoris .
seperate the bad thing and move on !
if she will tell the administration i will be expelled coz its pakistan not america
you should get to know her and sooner or later you will ask her out or she will .
maybe you and i can get together sometime & we 'll find love with one another .
i would be , but i 'm just married !
play the field a bit now .
as everyone said ... dont get married so early .
just want to know have you been to the doc yet !
pay attention to what the other person says !
just talk your spouse about this
if you are into sixth graders you are obviously young .
ask if they wan na go somewhere with you .
-a trip to amusement park such as roller coaster or even theatrical museum .
or do guys really do prefer bigger women ?
problem is i really like him .
should i dump him because of his mother
i did this before ( accidentally ) and my friend was mad that i deleted him !
i dont think i mind either way .
but thats her way ... you could try it that way or you could just keep your eyes open ...
there are some that do , but you should be able to tel .
r u talking about ur avatar ?
i dont ever remember giving a girl a cristmas gift unless i liked her .
i do n't know what to do .
try to be your self and do n't show off
so just take it day by day-step by step.think of how he lost a good thing .
compliments , honesty and make it about her .
i think hse will crash him !
it just means that she is really interested in the guy .
please do.. im thinking you would get slapped mid-reach , or kicked in the groin .
only now she and i are both divorced .
if he/she want to see you picture rightaway it sex !
hey it 's better than her givin u a fake # to call lol !
tell her to move to mass ... ... ... ... .
if you feel this strongly about it then maybe you should n't get married .
the pictures i 've seen ... i would say maui or the bahamas .
the guy i like is mad at me .
you 're 13 do n't even worry about it ...
that way you dont have to worry about you calling him too much !
i am a guy and let me tell you , we love to chase !
thanks for the pep in advance !
we always seem to push the ones taht we love away .
they think that they can control other peoples lives when thye cant
thats weird but maybe idk ill talk to my friend by his locker .
if a guy cares he calls .
what special gift can i give my would be brother in law for his birthday ?
he probably doesnt want to either .
some guys do ... and some guys do n't .
the timing just wasnt right for it with the old guy ... you 'll see !
generally kind and my fifth : i 'll just be dissapointed if she 's stupid .
its one of the gifts we can always give ourselves .
i do not believe trust has to be earned , because how is that even possible .
do n't let her rule your life , she will just have to learn to deal with it .
i have yahoo email and that works for me .
i would n't worry too much about it .
oh yes , the trick ass hoe 's never had a chance .
when you can fart in front of the one your dating
depends on how old they are .
and any guy who sas he woul is prolly not being entirely honest with himself .
if you flirt with him , the challange is not there .
if you need your x emotionally - then ya got some troubles .
20 to 32 ... she does n't have to be younger than you .
my be she do n't love you but try to use your brean not your haerd
there are tons of cheap ideas out there , just find what you like and work with it !
and if you are worried about doing it - performance wise - dont .
find a nother girl and if that dosent work move back
most often ( not always ) that will be guys around your age , give ot take .
if u you act like dat all da time she might think u desperate .
not everyone on here is in school .
should i make the first move or should i wait for him to make the first move ?
after a while you dont even see the color .
: ) i have n't tried it yet , but i am still trying to get up the nerve ... .
if you two are serious then asking her that question should n't bother her .
sak her out what 's up with that ?
how about ... would you like to go out with me sometime ?
those was good times i tells ya .
its all about her , and no it shouldnt be something that happends on a first date .
do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time .
you are too good for them
depending on the age , cds or dvds .
20 years down the road that is all you can be so start from the beginning
ill like to visit usa what are the needfull things
u sound like a very lovely person so dont let some of these gals drag you down .
you dont look , just go out and enjoy yourself and have fun and a gf will come along .
do n't persue it , he is getting married .
like clear liquid and turns yellow when dry ?
then when she starts closing her eyes , kiss her in the lipps and then its up to you !
please be honest with me i can handle the truth
its shows how much they care about you !
tell her that you miss her and that you love her .
coffee , lunch , site seeing , walk/talk/play in the park , museum , movie matinee
what you whant is a hooker , you can find that in any corner of the world .
but now we do all these things together and i dont know what to do..
because if it fails you be up $ h*t !
and its been the best thing for at least me .
the problem is that he cheated on me recently and it was the worst that he could of done .
if you are happy she should be happy , unless he really is being bad to you .
we like it when guys do things for us and think about us .
maybe if you give him space he will eventually call you back .
tell him you do n't want a real relationship .
if you look creepy and you look..they 'll all think you 're leering .
i do n't know about love , but he likes you for sure
if a guy really respects u then he 'll understand .
ask yourself and decide.and if you can afford it , do if you want to .
because he is a superhero that is the closest to being just a regular guy .
sometimes the difficulties are worth it if the the good outweighs the bad
i dont think it is wise to date at work .
let it take it 's course from there .
about what they think about gay marrige/ relationshiops ?
so ofcourse i had to ask him if he was blowin me off .
guys will think youre hot no matter what with this usually .
but i dont htink that by not having sex with him he will become unfaithful or leave you .
marriage is really about trusting & communicating
ok , so i had this problem too .
depending on what you kissed ; )
it depends on if you could trust him before !
make sure you dont make her hate you just get your point across too her
uh- wher 've u been meeting these filipinas ?
that way , you are n't exactly telling them what you specifically do n't like about them .
if he is , then go for it !
then see if shes open for a dinner & a movie .
hey im sorry i do n't know and i wish best of luck to both of you !
however -- -- i find him looking at me every now and then .
this is sin , our selves have started this
fun includes eating meals ( not breakfast if yo know what i mean ) .
make a kind move , if no responce u know what to do !
let him make the first move if u do it may make u look like ur ubsesd with him !
you people have no right to get married !
my tragic love story was i loved him very much and he loved me too .
u seem desperate and you 'll never find a if you 're desperate .
but he swears that we 're just friends .
looks do n't really matter unless you are trying to prove something .
again , i know once u have sex with him , he is no longer a good friend .
the fact that a guy is sooo self centered is a huge turn off for me .
do n't rush it feel all your emotions come alive .
it a two way traffic until you get them you will know which one it is
so you have one baby out of wedlock .
i know i 'm overtly picky about people how can i stop it !
it hurts ... .alot ... maybe some girls might say that 's it ?
im going to jump that boy is that the right choice
so it was a good ideea !
if she gets drunk then it is not a turn off .
because some women send men tiny messages with out saying it clearly .
i 'd perfer if they left me alone ... sorry , i got off-topic .
ask her to go do something she is interested in or to see a movie she 'd like .
haha ... too bad it 's not automatic like msn or aol .
and thats how they 'll react to it so yea its bad situation for you and him .
go back to that person at once before it becomes too late for you .
lol i too want to smack that smile off her face
and ask if he wants to dance with you .
then she might say that looks ugly i think ( a color ) looks better .
ask him to go see a doc .
i never went out with him a second time .
first of all , why did u guys break up ?
why wait , , , , , go ahead do it
as long as he dosent mind , who elses opinion matters ?
i think im still totally in love w/ him ...
i never wanted to have sex again .
the main thing is to not try to get back at the one who wronged you .
if u have to ask other people i really dont think ur ready to
im a gilr , i say those things ... .
a big savings area is flowers .
time wiil tell give it six months and see what happens .
either that or you are the only one he has a chance at getting some booty from
well from your list , i would have to choose spiderman .
i was cheated on for 3 of the years .
all seniors think freshman girls are easy , its sad but true
and if he says yes than you can tell him .
and impress her with affection and love .
and if you have , what was it like ?
celebrate valentine with joy and fun ... give eachother gifts and hav a fun ...
